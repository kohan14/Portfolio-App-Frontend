# PortfolioApp

This was my first attempt to Angular. Code is a total mess (especially css/components). I Managed to implement some features like:
* Form with validation
* Sending form content via http post request and then forwarding the content as email message with ASP.NET Core Web Api SMTP Client.
* Simple download file stream from backend server to user via http get request

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
